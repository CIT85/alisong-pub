            <h2>information about clay</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">Pottery clay is a natural material formed over millennia through the weathering of rocks, primarily feldspar. It is composed of fine particles of minerals such as kaolinite, quartz, and mica, which give it its pliability and workability. Different types of clay, such as earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain, have unique properties suited to various pottery techniques and firing temperatures.</li>
                <li class="list">Pottery clay shrinks as it dries and again during firing, typically reducing in size by 10-15%. Understanding shrinkage is essential for designing pieces with precise dimensions.</li>
                <li class="list">Clay's ability to hold its shape while being molded, known as plasticity, depends on its particle size and water content. More plastic clays are easier to shape but may require careful handling to avoid cracking.
                </li>
                <li class="list">The color of clay varies depending on the minerals it contains, ranging from white to gray, red, and even brown or black. These natural tones can influence the final aesthetic of pottery pieces.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>information about glazes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="list">Glazes are typically made from a mixture of silica (for glass formation), alumina (to prevent the glaze from running), and fluxes (to lower the melting temperature). Additives like oxides or stains are used to create specific colors and effects.</li>
                <li class="list">Glazes interact with the clay body during firing, creating a fused, glass-like surface. The chemical reaction between the glaze and clay can produce unexpected or unique effects, especially in high-temperature firings.</li>
                <li class="list">Glazes are formulated for specific firing temperatures. Low-fire glazes produce bright colors and glossy finishes, while mid- and high-fire glazes often create more muted or natural tones with added durability.</li>
                <li class="list">Glazes used on functional pottery must be food-safe, meaning they should not leach harmful substances when in contact with food or drink. This is especially important for pottery intended for daily use.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li class="list">
                    A kiln is a high-temperature oven used to fire clay, transforming it into durable ceramics. It hardens the clay and glazes, making the pieces functional and long-lasting. Kilns can reach temperatures from 1,800°F to over 2,400°F.
                </li>
                <li class="list">
                    Common kilns include electric kilns (ideal for controlled, consistent firing), gas kilns (great for achieving unique effects through reduction firing), and wood-fired kilns (traditional and used for natural, textured finishes).
                </li>
                <li class="list">
                    A pottery wheel is used to shape clay into symmetrical forms, such as bowls, plates, and vases. It allows for precision and speed in creating pottery.
                </li>
                <li class="list">
                    Electric pottery wheels are motorized for ease and consistency, while kick wheels require manual operation and are favored for their traditional feel. Many wheels include adjustable speed settings and splash pans to contain excess water and clay.
