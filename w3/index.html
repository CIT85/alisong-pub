            <h3>choosing the right tree for your climate</h3>
            <h4>climate is important:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>select fruit trees that are suited to your climate. some trees, like citrus, thrive in warm climates, while apples and pears can tolerate colder temperatures. check your usda hardiness zone to find suitable trees for your area.</li>
                    <li>here in fresno, we need to grow trees that require few chill hours. our hardiness zone is 9 in the valley here. </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>space requirements:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>consider the space you have available. dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties are good for small spaces or even large pots, while full-size trees need more room to spread.</li>
                    <li>apple and cherry trees tend to be the biggest while citrus tends to be the smallest</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>pollination needs:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>some fruit trees are self-pollinating (like peaches and apricots), while others (like apples and cherries) need a second tree for cross-pollination to bear fruit.</li>
                    <li>you can rely on pollinating insects or you cna hand-pollinate</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>planting your tree</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>for most fruit trees, spring or fall are the best times to plant. in warmer climates, avoid planting in the heat of summer</li>
                        <li>dig a hole twice as wide as the root ball and about as deep. loosen the soil at the bottom and place the tree so that the graft line (a visible bump near the base) is just above the soil line.</li>
                        <li>refill the hole with soil, gently tamping it down to eliminate air pockets. water thoroughly to help the roots settle and remove air gaps.</li>
                    </ol>

            <h3>caring for your trees</h3>
                <h4>watering</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Young trees need regular watering, especially in the first few years. Water deeply once or twice a week, ensuring moisture reaches the root zone.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>once a tree is older it needs less water</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>mulching and fertilizing</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p> Apply mulch around the base to retain moisture, moderate soil temperature, and suppress weeds. Keep the mulch a few inches from the trunk to prevent rot.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Feed your tree with balanced fertilizer or compost in early spring and mid-summer. Avoid over-fertilizing, which can lead to excessive growth at the expense of fruiting.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>pruning</h4>
                    <p>Prune in late winter when the tree is dormant to shape it and remove dead or diseased branches. Summer pruning can help control size but should be done lightly.</p>
