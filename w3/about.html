    <section id="aboutai">
        <h2 class="abouth2">how i feel about using chatgpt for this project</h2><br>
            <p>this is how i feel about using chatgpt:</p>
            <p>i don't feel confident using chatgpt for research, i know that it improves over time as users input data but i don't personally feel that it has reached a level of accuracy that i trust yet. i've seen too many examples of ai getting things wrong for me to truly trust it yet. i like using it to get ideas for research topics to look deeper into, but i would never rely on it for actual research or education. i have heard of ai software that is designed for research that is supposed to be more accurate so i would like to try that option someday (can't remember the name). i like using chatgpt more as a tool to improve my coding skills rather than researching and learning. </p>
